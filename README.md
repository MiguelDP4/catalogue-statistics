## Micro-Dex

This is a super basic poke-dex application. For the moment, it will only search, filter and sort pokemon by type and name, and order them by pokedex number, by name or by type (alphabetically). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Built With:

- Javascript
- React
- Redux

## Features

- Pokemon are loaded and organized when the application is loaded.
- You can search for pokemon by typing their name on the text input on the navigation bar.
- You can filter pokemon by type by selecting a type on the drop down box on the navigation bar.
- You can order the pokemon by either name, pokedex number or type with the dropdown on the navigation bar.

## Planned future features

- Display more pokemon data (evolution lines, links to that pokemon's evolution, attacks it can learn, etc).
- Ask user permission to use local storage so the page doesn't need to load every time.
- User account creation so users can create pokemon teams
