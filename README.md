## Micro-Dex

This is a super basic poke-dex application. For the moment, it will only search, filter and sort pokemon by type and name, and order them by pokedex number, by name or by type (alphabetically). 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Built With:

- Javascript
- React
- Redux
